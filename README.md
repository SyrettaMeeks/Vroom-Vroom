Introduction
I've conducted a comprehensive analysis of Toyota vehicle pricing and depreciation across Boston, MA and Ocean Springs, MS. The dataset contains information on 618 Toyota vehicles, primarily consisting of 4Runners and Tacomaâ€™s with various trim levels, years, and mileage. This report presents my findings on price distributions, depreciation patterns, and provides specific recommendations for 3-year-old vehicles. The price range spans from $4,995 to $71,990, while mileage ranges from as low as 5 miles to as high as 278,000 miles. This diverse dataset provides a foundation for analyzing market differences between the two locations.

Conclusion
My analysis reveals distinct market analysis between Boston and Ocean Springs that impact both buyers and sellers. Ocean Springs consistently maintains higher prices across all model years and conditions, creating a market premium of approximately 13%. However, Boston vehicles tend to retain value better over time, with slower depreciation rates compared to Ocean Springs.
For consumers, these findings suggest different strategies depending on location and goals. Purchasing in Boston offers better long-term value retention, while Ocean Springs may provide better selling opportunities for relatively new vehicles. Dealerships could optimize inventory by considering these regional differences in pricing and depreciation when transferring stock between locations.
